## App Description
This application retrieves data from the Star Wars API https://swapi.co/. The application renders movie data for the user in the form of cards.  The user is able to favorite/unfavorite cards.

This project was design to develop my ability to write asynchronous code, deal with nested fetch calls, fetch data from an api, manipulate data, build a successful application using React.js, effectively test React components, and build a functioning application in a collaborative work environment.
